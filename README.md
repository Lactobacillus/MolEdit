# MolEdit: *In-silico* 3D Molecular Editing through Physics-Informed and Peference-Aligned Generative Foundation Models

This is the github repo for the paper "*In-silico* 3D Molecular Editing through Physics-Informed and Peference-Aligned Generative Foundation Models". An early version is preprinted at [doi:10.26434/chemrxiv-2023-j2n6l-v2](doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2023-j2n6l-v2).

MolEdit, developed by the Gao Group at Peking University, is a molecular generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) designed to address the complex challenges of *molecular editing*. This fundamental aspect of functional molecule design involves the generation, modification, and evolution of molecules with specified structural and chemical features. Our goal is to develop molecular GenAIs as powerful as image-based GenAIs, such as image denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs).

## Multimodal Generation of Molecules 
We propose an asynchronous multimodal diffusion schedule for molecular DDPMs. This approach makes it possible to rigorously handle molecular symmetries (various point groups), and facilitates robust generation across various molecular modalities, including SMILES, graphs, and 3D structures.<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/issacAzazel/MolEdit/blob/main/figs/generation_example.png" width="70%"></p>

## Imbue Diffusion Models with Symmetry-Awareness via Group-Optimized Labeling
We develop Group-Optimized Denoising Diffusion (GODD), that explicitly integrates group actions into DDPMs. GODD functions through group-optimized labeling, which serves as a plug-and-play and non-invasive modification to DDPM training objectives. GODD enhances the model's awareness of the diverse molecular symmetries embedded in various molecular point groups.<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/issacAzazel/MolEdit/blob/main/figs/symmetry.png" width="70%"></p>

## Hallucination Suppression via Physics-alignment
To suppress hallucinations of physically unstable and chemically invalid structures (atom clashes, inappropriate bond lengths, and incorrect valences) generated by molecular GenAIs, we draw inspiration from preference alignment techniques used in mainstream GenAIs. We implement a Boltzmann-Gaussian mixture (BGM) kernel for physics alignment. This approach, grounded in statistical mechanics and molecular force fields, built upon a "Hamiltonian oracle" and significantly improves the stability of structures in the molecules generated.<p align="center">

## Versatile and Controllable Design and Editing of Functional Molecules
Inspired by the success of image GenAIs, a foundational molecular GenAI should be able to respond to various specifications of molecular editing. Therefore, we equip MolEdit with flexible controls in context of multiple conditions. For instance, MolEdit is able to control the shape of molecules using the radius of gyration. The model can also be conditioned on (sub)molecular graphs and "inpaint" the missing motifs given predefined chemical contexts like fragments, groups, etc., and/or given geometric restraints like substructures, orientations, etc. This controllable generation strategy also facilitates MolEdit to render diverse high-quality structures from textual molecular representations like SMILES and graphs.

Detailed examples can be found in notebook [moledit.ipynb](./moledit.ipynb)!
