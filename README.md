# MolEdit: Versatile Molecular Editing via Multimodal and Group-optimized Generative Learning

This is the github repo for the paper ["Versatile Molecular Editing via Multimodal and Group-optimized Generative Learning"](https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2023-j2n6l).

MolEdit is a multimodal, group-optimized, physics-informed and controllable generative method for molecular systems, developed by Gao Group, Peking University. With MolEdit, we aim to solve the challenge of molecular editing, a central concept in functional molecule design, which encompasses the generation, modification and evolution of molecules towards desired properties with specified structural features.

## Multimodal Generation of Molecules 
We propose the multimodal likelihood decomposition to tackle the problem of "discreteness-continuity duality" in molecules. This approach allows us to robustly generate multiple modalities of molecules, including constituents, graphs, and structures.

## Learning Symmetry-preserving distributions
We develop group-optimized score matching (GOSM) which mathematically includes group actions in diffusion models. GOSM has the capability to learn a distribution which preserves the symmetry under any groups, including SE(3) and permutation groups that are commonly appear in molecular systems.

## Physics-informed Diffusion Models 
To relax the non-physical and unreasonable structures (e.g., atom clashes, too long or too short bonds, incorrect valences) generated by data-driven probabilistic models, we propose the use of Boltzmann-Gaussian mixture (BGM) kernel in the construction of forward and backward diffusion process. By introducing concepts in statistical mechanics and molecular force field, we successfully alleviate the stress in generate structures.

## Controllable Editing of Generated Molecules
As a compelling feature, MolEdit can operate following various prompts that specify conditional information about molecular constituents, subgraphs as well as substructures, and flexibly generate precisely edited molecular graphs and their corresponding conformers.
